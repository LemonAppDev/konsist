# Test KoScope

These projects are used to test the `KoScopeCreatorImpl` class. Each project uses a double configuration 
([Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)).

For sample projects see
the [konsist-sample-projects](https://github.com/LemonAppDev/konsist-sample-projects/) repository.
