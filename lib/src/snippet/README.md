# Snippet Source Set

The source set includes code snippets (`.ktdoc` files) for the documentation under the `com.lemonappdev.konsist`
package, as well as classes and interfaces that simulate commonly used Kotlin classes and interfaces (`androidx`, 
`kotlinx`, `javax`, etc. ) to enhance the realism of the snippets and make code compile without requiring additional 
dependencies to be added to the project.

The snippets are placed here to ensure that the documentation always reflects the most current and
functional code.

To update GitBook documentation run
[deploy_snippets_to_konsist_documentation_repo.py](../../../scripts/deploy_snippets_to_konsist_documentation_repo) script.
