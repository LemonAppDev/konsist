# What is Konsist?

Konsist is a library that helps to guard [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) codebase consistency. It facilitates standardization of the Kotlin codebase by enforcing coding conventions and guarding project architecture.&#x20;

At high-level Konsist can:

* verify if classes reside in correct packages
* verify if classes reside in correct packages



Example checks:

* Check if all repository classes are reside in repository package
* Check if every use case has one public function
* Check if class is not using forbidden dependencies
* Check if `Controller` class is annotated with `@Controller` Annotation
* Check if use case has one public function
* Check if no classes are using Java util logging
* and much moreâ€¦ see sample checks



Konsist tests are written in Kotlin. Here is a simple test that verifies if every use case class resides in `usecase` package:

```kotlin
@Test
fun `every use case must reside in use case package`() {
    KoScope
        .fromProject() // Define scope using all Kotlin files present in the project
        .classes() // Map to list of classes
        .withNameSuffix("UseCase") // Filter classes heaving name ending with 'UseCase'
        .assert { it.resideInPackages("..usecase..") } // Assert use case
}
```

Konsist works with any test framework that executes Kotlin code such as [JUni4](https://junit.org/junit4/) and [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/).
